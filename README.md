# Library Assistant (Web) ![](https://travis-ci.org/maloneyl/library-assistant-web.svg?branch=master)

This is a simple single-page app that shows me a batch of books which are recently added to my Goodreads to-read shelf and which are found in the Islington Library catalogue. It's a useful little tool for me, and I'm using this project to try some front-end things.
